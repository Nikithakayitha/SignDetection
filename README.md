1.Code.ipynb
    Complete coding part for sign detection which involves:
      *Setting Paths
      *Creating Label Map
      *Creating tensorflow records
      *Downloading TF Models
      *Copying Model Configuration to Training Folder
      *Updating Configuration For Transfer Learning
      *Training the model
      *Loading Trained Model From Checkpoint
      *Detecting in Real-Time

2.CodeToCaptureImagesWithCamera
    This code enables us to capture images which is used to train the model in recognizing the sign in real time.
